#### hi
#### This is my second assignment and the source is from gapminder.

## Revision version 1.0
1. made some revision of the visualization_function:

   a. filter the country that we need and extract the data of 2 countries into one dataframe;
   b. add geom_point to show every data point; add legend to clarify which line represent the corresponding country

2. added one new plot:

   a. revision: make the scatter plot and draw lines which are the fitted function with linear regression and error bars.
   b. prerequisite: By doing so, we simply regards the data of dates vs or(food_supply, sugar, percentage) are linearly correlated.
   c. benefits by doing so: We can check if there are a significant difference between 2 countries we choose.
   
3. added some comments on wraggling_code:

   a. when use left_join, it is better to "by".
