# Introduction

The dietary health issues is a popular problem nowadays. Excess sugar consumption is one of the serious health problems that appeared in many countries. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the maximum amount of added sugars you should eat in a day are 37.5 grams per day for male and 25 grams per day for female. However, in most countries, people would take in an amount of sugar which is far from the regular basis. As modern grocery shoppers, we try to be engaged and knowledgeable about nutrition. So, I did this analysis between The quantity of food consumption of sugar and sweeteners (grams per person and day) and calories measures the energy content of the food. And I try to find that the change in the sugar intake from 1960 to 2012 and test whether people prefer to eat sweeter food in a different country. So I choose two-country Solomon Islands and Thailand. Make a comparison of sugar, food supply, and the percentage.

## source

##Read R Code from the file "wrangling_code.R" and "visualization_function.R"

# Wrangling_code

```{R}

#Load the packages: tidyr, dplyr 
library(readxl)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

```

```{R}

#Read the excel file and get the dataset of food supply and sugar
food_supply <- read_excel("food_supply_kilocalories_per_person_and_day.xlsx")
sugar <- read_excel("sugar_per_person_g_per_day.xlsx")

```


```{R}

#To tidy a dataset, pivot the offending columns into a new pair of variables
tidy_food_supply <- pivot_longer(food_supply, 2:54, names_to = "year", values_to = "food_supply")
tidy_sugar <- pivot_longer(sugar, '1960':'2012', names_to = "year", values_to = "sugar")

#To combine the tidied versions of tidy_sugar and tidy_food_supply into a single tibble, we need to use left_join(), which youâ€™ll learn about in relational data.
tidy_data <- left_join(tidy_food_supply, tidy_sugar)

```

```{R}
#Drop tibble's rows containing missing values
tidy_data <- drop_na(tidy_data)

#Mutate adds new variables and preserves existing
#the new variable is percentage which is sugar/food_supply
tidy_data <- mutate(tidy_data, 
                    percentage = sugar/food_supply)
